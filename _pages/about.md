I am a lecturer in the Department of Computing at Atlantic Technological University Donegal, where I supervise MSc and PhD students, and teach modules in mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, and data science, principally on the [MSc in Big Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/LY_KDAAI_M/BigDataAnalyticsandArtificialIntelligence), [MSc in Data Science](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/NC1080/DataScience&PreparatoryCertificateinComputing) and [BSc in Computing & AI](https://www.lyit.ie/CourseDetails/D303/AU_363). I am currently programme chair for the latter two courses.

Prior to this, I spent three years as a research engineer at [Valeo Vision Systems](https://www.valeo.com/en/), working on deep learning algorithms for computer vision.
Before that, I completed a PhD in Applied Mathematics, in the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at the University of Galway.

My research focuses on machine learning applications across natural language processing and computer vision. For further information see the publications listed on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HuCttXIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar profile</a>. I am a member of the ATU [Centre for Mathematical Modelling & Intelligent Systems for Health & Environment](https://www.mishe.ie/) and [Wireless Sensor and Applied Research Lab (WiSAR)](https://www.wisar.ie/).
